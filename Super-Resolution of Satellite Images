# Super-Resolution of Satellite Images

This repository contains the implementation of Super-Resolution of Satellite Images as part of the AI for Sustainability initiative. The project aims to enhance the resolution of low-quality satellite images using deep learning techniques such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and Transformer-based models. This work contributes to environmental monitoring and object detection for improved decision-making in sustainability applications.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to generate high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This can improve:
- Detection of pollution sources
- Analysis of urban development
- Monitoring of deforestation and land-use changes
- Tracking disaster-prone areas

## Research References
This project is inspired by and builds upon research from IIT Gandhinagarâ€™s Sustainability Lab. Relevant research papers include:
1. Space to Policy: Scalable Brick Kiln Detection and Automatic Compliance Monitoring with Geospatial Data
2. Scalable Methods for Brick Kiln Detection and Compliance Monitoring from Satellite Imagery: A Deployment Case Study in India

## Methodology
1. Dataset Preparation
   - We use open-source satellite imagery datasets
   - Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase generalizability

2. Model Development
   - Implement CNN-based Super-Resolution (SRCNN VDSR)
   - Use GAN-based models (SRGAN ESRGAN) for photorealistic results
   - Explore Transformer-based methods for enhanced feature extraction

3. Training & Evaluation
   - Loss functions: MSE Perceptual Loss and Adversarial Loss
   - Metrics: PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
