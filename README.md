# Satellite-Superrs
This repository contains the implementation of Super-Resolution of Satellite Images as part of the AI for Sustainability initiative. The project aims to enhance the resolution of low-quality satellite images using deep learning techniques such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks).
